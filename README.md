The file 'margins-GPDtails.R' contains functions to handle the required marginal transformations.

The files 'estimation-Contour1.R' and 'estimation-Contour2.R' contain functions to run our estimation procedure for contour definitions 1 and 2, respectively.

The file 'example.R' contains a simple example of how to use the functions for environmental contour estimation.
